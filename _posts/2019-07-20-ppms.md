Two years ago a process started at HolidayCheck that changed our IT organisation as we knew it before. One ambitious idea, various refinements, an internal recruiting process, some . In the next lines, we will describe you with two voices why and how this all happened and the challenges we 

I am one of them and this is how my life has changed during the last 400 days.

But first of all, let's check some of the background.

## Who are we?

To preface, who are we and why are we talking about this? 

Álvaro: I am a Frontend Developer with a big passion: creating visually attractive products that impacts the user so they will not forget it so easily. I have always loved to work closely with the product owners and designers and bringing our ideas live. I have been working five years at HolidayCheck (with a three years break, immersed on an entrepreneur-adventure) and embraced the challenge of becoming a People (and Practice) Manager a little bit more than a yer ago. Working with my people, discussing with them, finding together the right path and motivating them and everyone around me have become my new passion.

## HolidayCheck's biggest Orga change 

### The idea

At the end of 2017, our CTO and the two Heads of Technology at that time started to think how to improve the IT organisation to solve some of the challenges they were facing: 

- 30 developers were reporting to one person, what was overwhelming
- the developer did not feel heard and recognised for the great work she/he was doing
- being developers from three different locations did not help to the vision of one IT

So they decided to address these points by investing in the the best we have at HolidayCheck: the people. The goal was to find 8 to 10 developers in-house that were willing to take the challenge to become (partly) people managers. They should not just be the classic People Manager but something different: PPMs. 

### First steps

As with every other internal recruiting process, surely the first step was defining the role and that was not easy. There were some factors that would define this position:

- become a strong team by virtaully joining people from different locations (focusing on remote collaboration)
- form groups of developers with similar interests around the PPM-to-be's passion
- keeping 50% of hands-on, both to not to lose touch with what we love and leaving the door open for a stepping back to being a 100% developer again
- 

After having the first clear idea, a verbose role description draft and some refinements through several meetings with all of us, the application time started. It was the moment for us to decide, if we are up to the next chapter in our (working) life.

### Application time!

Álvaro

From the first moment I heard about the possibility of becoming a PPM, I felt intrigued. It has never been easy for me to make quick decisions and this one was going to change my career path as none did before. My gut feeling told me this was a train I could not miss and I jumped with eyes closed and the mind open. Becoming a Team Lead was always one of my goals and I could not imagine a better opportunity: a safe environment (after so many years at HolidayCheck), the possibility to keep doing what I knew I was good at and the idea of growing together with a group of developers in this new role.
